# Charmed HPC Terraform

Terraform modules for deploying components of a Charmed HPC cluster.

The [`modules`](./modules) directory contains modules that make use of the
[Juju Terraform Provider](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju) to interact with a
previously bootstrapped [Juju](https://juju.is) controller.

Furthermore, the [`examples`](./examples) directory offers example deployments that can be copy-pasted
to kickstart your own deployments.

## ‚ú® Getting started

A Juju 3.x controller [bootstrapped](https://juju.is/docs/juju/bootstrapping) on your choice of cloud is required. Steps for deploying:

```shell
# Prerequisites
juju bootstrap <cloud name> <controller name>
sudo snap install --classic opentofu
```

Then, create a Terraform plan to deploy the core components:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    juju = {
      source  = "juju/juju"
      version = ">= 0.16.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "juju" {}

resource "juju_model" "charmed-hpc" {
  name = "charmed-hpc"
}

## MySQL - provides backing database for the accounting node.
module "mysql" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/canonical/mysql-operator//terraform"

  juju_model_name = juju_model.charmed-hpc.name
  app_name        = "mysql"
  channel         = "8.0/stable"
  units           = 1
}

module "slurm" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/charmed-hpc/charmed-hpc-terraform//modules/slurm"

  model_name = juju_model.charmed-hpc.name
  database_backend = {
    name     = module.mysql.application_name,
    endpoint = module.mysql.provides.database
  }

  # Optional settings for the controller node.
  controller = {
    app_name = "slurmctld"
  }

  # Optional settings for the database node.
  database = {
    app_name = "slurmdbd"
  }

  # Optional settings for the REST API node.
  rest_api = {
    app_name = "slurmrestd"
  }

  # Optional settings for the kiosk node.
  kiosk = {
    app_name = "sackd",
    units    = 1,
  }

  # Compute partitions to be deployed.
  compute_partitions = {
    "default" : {
      units = 1,
    },
    "gpu" : {
      units = 1,
    }
  }
  depends_on = [
    juju_model.charmed-hpc
  ]
}
```

Finally, plan and deploy!

```shell
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

A useful command to help while hacking on the plans is:

```shell
just check  # Checks file formatting and syntax are valid.
```
